I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree with specialization in **Computer Science Engineering** from [Manipal University Jaipur, India](https://jaipur.manipal.edu/). 

I have an undying passion towards cricket commentary and public speaking. Analysis and commentary of the gentleman's game are the aspects that excite me the most!

I have been watching and playing cricket since before my teenage years and to be able to contribute to the game in any manner possible is what I wish to achieve through this space. 

### MY FAVOURITE PLAYERS
Brett Lee, Yuvraj Singh

### MY FAVOURITE MATCH 
Althogh extremely tough to choose one particular game, I would go for the Indo-Pak final of the inaugural T20 World Cup. 

### MY DREAM TEAM
Sachin Tendulkar, Adam Gilchrist, Kumar Sangakkara (WK), Yuvraj Singh, AB De Villiers, Shoaib Malik, Andrew Flintoff, Brett Lee, Imran Tahir, Jasprit Bumrah, Dale Steyn
