</div> -->

The former England Captain and opener is one of the best batsman of this modern-day era of batting. He played 161 Tests and 92 ODIs and scored 12472 and 3204 runs in them respectively. With more than 12,000 test runs and 33 centuries to his name, one of the greatest batsmen to have ever played the game is relatively underappreciated in terms of his achievements in the current era of cricket.

<h3>(2) GAUTAM GAMBHIR </h3>

The former Indian opener who has played many match winning innings including those in ICC tournaments is also one of the most underrated in terms of his achievements. Gambhir played for India in all formats and was quite succeessful too. If one remembers the 2007 ICC World T20 Final, the first thoughts are the catch taken by Sreesanth, while only few remember the contribution of Gambhir where he scored a 54 ball 75 which ended up being more than half of the Indian team’s total. Gambhir also played an important innings in the 2011 WC final. His 122 ball 97 is one of the best knocks in the World Cup history but is usually overshadowed by the knock played by Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

Hussey played with an average of almost 50 in both formats and rescued the team in many instances. However, with players like Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden, he was underappreciated in terms of his achievements and contribution to the team.
