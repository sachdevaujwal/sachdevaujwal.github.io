"Unlimited Stock Supply" is a data science project undertaken as a summer intern at the Indian Statistical Institute, New Delhi Centre.

The project was carefully worked upon and reviewed for a period of two months, under the guidance of Professor S.K. Neogy, Head - ISI, Delhi. Starting in May 2018, it was completed in July 2018.

The language used to create this basic overview is Python, and has been performed on Jupyter Notebooks. 

### ABSTRACT
The objective of the project was to create a basic inventory management system, which is not just easily accessible, but also simple to comprehend. The idea behind this came from the common issue of interrupted availability of many products with high levels of popularity. 

It works a very small, sample data set of 100 products, wherein the quantity available of each product is set to 150 units. The source code, then, assigns a score to each product based on its features and specifications (Colour, Internal Memory, Brand Value, RAM, etc.) and updates the sale of every product simultaneously. 

It takes into account the average sale of that product over a large time for high accuracy and predicts the sale over the upcoming days. Moreover, it keeps in check the procurement time of that particular product and gives out a handy, in-time message as a reminder to refill the stock of the product.

The main advantage of this is that it not just allows to estimate the upcoming sales and profit, but also maintains a statistical analysis of the sales records and plots that help to rapidly know the profits and remainder of the stock. 

Although, there is great scope for development in the project, it is a very simple model of how to obtain "Uninterupted Stock Supply".
